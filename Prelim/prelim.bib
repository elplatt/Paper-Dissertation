Weak ties, between individuals without common neighbors, act as bridges between different parts of social networks, with important consequences for diffusion of information.
Sociometry was the precursor to network analysis. Networks connect micro- and macro- sociology. How small group behavior relates to larger properties of a society.
Strength: time, emotional intensity, intimacy, reciprocal services. Paper uses intuitive understanding. Asserts "the stronger the tie between A and B, the larger the proportion of individuals in S to whom they will both be tied, that is, connected by a weak or strong tie. Consistent with cognitive balance. Forbidden triad: A-B, A-C, but no B-C. No strong tie is a bridge.
Bridges provide the only path between two points (Harary et al.) Generalization: local bridge of degree n connects two points otherwise distance n.
"Intuitively speaking, this means that whatever is to be diffused can reach a larger number of people, and traverse greater social distance (i.e., path length), when passed through weak ties rather than strong."
Early innovators are marginal. Innovation spread by those with few weak ties are less likely to spread. "Hysteria" case, initial cases had few friends but interacted with many.
In Milgram's experiment, crossing race was most successful when done over a weak tie.
Network structure: "effective network" vs "extended network" (core-periphery).
Jobs. Workers find jobs through acquaintences. "Those to whom we are weakly tied are more likely to move in circles different from our own and will thus have access to information different from that which we receive."
Paths
Most often, information came directly from employers, otherwise through short paths. Long paths were similar to formal intermediaries.
Trust
(Long paths represent low-trust and require trust-building ritual). Trust in leaders depends on predictability and ability to influence their behavior. Fragmentation reduces.
(Can't make weak ties through friends, by definition. Need alternative ways to make ties. Possibly topic based. WikiProjects is good example, also academic conferences)
"Paradoxes are a welcome antidote to theories which explain everything all too neatly."}

Consensus: decision-making process, universal participation, maximum area of common acceptance (English \& English, 1958).
Purpose, conflict and resolution, leadership, power or influence, size, use of time.
Quakers seek Spirit of God and sense of the meeting. Process over outcome. Possible to disagree with consensus.
Requires more time but better solutions (Nemiroff \& King, 1975). Assures widespread support. Emergent solutions, even when there is initial agreement. (Collective intelligence). Requires training (Hall \& Williams 1970).
Hall \& Williams 1970
Avoid arguing for your own position.
Avoid win-lose stalemates in discussion.
Avoid changing your mind only in order to avoid conflict and to reach agreement and harmony.
Avoid conflict-reducing techniques such as majority vote, averaging, bargaining, coin flipping and the like.
View differences of opinion as both natural and helpful rather than as a hindrance in decision-making.

Perspectives and heuristics. Maximize an objective function. Perspective: mapping M from solutions into agent's internal representation. Heuristic: mapping A from solutions in internal rep to subset. (These might influence deliberation and be causes for differing rankings). Easy to collaborate with same perspective but different heuristics.

Introduction
"networked information economy". 1. Removal of physical constraints on information production. 2. Non-market production. 3. Large-scale cooperation and peer production.
"A person whose life and relations are fully regimented by external forces is unfree, no matter whether the source of regimentation can be understood as market-based, authoritarian, or traditional community values."
Networked Public Sphere
Fundamental differences: 1. network architecture (distributed, multiple connections), 2. cost of becoming a speaker. "The easy possibility of communicating effectively into thepublic sphere allows individuals to reorient themselves from passive readers and listeners to potential speakers and participants in a conversation."
Affordances. "blogs enable individuals to write to their Web pages in journalism time—that is, hourly, daily, weekly". Comments.
Large-scale collaborations. Characteristics: 1. very large groups, social software solutions: peer review, structured posting privileges, reputation systems 2. anchored by common text.
Mass media: 1. excessive power for owners, "potential for inordinate power" 2. tendency to foster inert policy. Example: Sinclair broadcasting 2004. 62 stations, documentary called by one staff member "blatant political propaganda." Online: boycott Sinclair site, strategy suggestion from anonymous reader, database of advertisers, organizing and training space for volunteers. Activity reported by Lehman Brothers, stock dropped 8\% that day, 6\% overnight. Sinclair altered plans to show documentary. Network-based media: wide participation, speed. Filtering and synthesis through discussion, trial, and error. (Task structure, not all tasks are amenable to trial-and-error.)
Generative power. Diebold Election Systems example. Mass-media did not cover security concerns. 2003, journalist Bev Harris got information through a wistle-blower site, published on scoop.com. Ubiquity of storage and "see for yourself". Widespread distribution to circumvent suppression. Resulted in decertification of some systems and shift in policy. Students created multiple copies, also posted to FreeNet.
Responses to critiques
1. Information overload. Money will dominate anyway, fragmentation of discourse, polarization. Heavy tail. "not too concentrated or too chaotic." "Attention on the network has more to do with mobilizing the judgements, links, and cooperation of large bodies of small-scale contributors than with applying large sums of money."
2. Centralization of Internet infrastructure and attention. Market concentration of access. Eli Noam 2003: internet concentrated 1984-2002. Under competition market will keep prices and concentration low, under oligopolistic conditions, too expensive to remain neutral. Attention. "In order to extract information out of the universe of statements made possible by the Internet, users are freely adopting practices that lead to the emergency of a new hierarchy." Moderately read sites provide new platforms. Barabasi and Albert. "The most intriguing result of our Web-mapping project was the complete /absence/ of democracy, fairness, and egalitarian values on the Web," (Linked). Sinclair example: "Network topology helped facilitate all these components of the public sphere, rather than undermine them." (Heterarchy vs heirarchy, heavy tail). Adamic and Huberman, intrinsic growth factor instead of preferential attachment.
i. At micro-level, sites cluster,
ii. macro, strongly connected cores. Bow-tie, SCC, tendrils, tubes. SCC emerges after threshold (Kumar).
iii. small clusters deviate from power law, obscurity diminishes, superstars visible "filtering and transmission backbone."
iv. small world. Short paths
Heterarchy. Loose order, redundant paths, topical/organizational clusters.
Self-organiztion. Polarization: 10\% of sites link across conservative/liberal divide (Adamic and Glance). Many initial statements or inquiries die (reduces diversity, Deliberation Day, HP2004).
Structure and clustering (not algorithms) to
3. Mass-media as watchdog.
Examples from Sinclair and Diebold. "Smart Mobs" (Reingold)
4. Authoritarian filtering and monitoring. (Monitoring more dangerous, can't be detected).
Redundancies. "It is much harder to shut down all connections from all reporters to a server and from the server back into a country wherever a computer exists."
5. Digital divide.},

Examines role of implicit and explicit coordination in the relationship between crowd size and article quality on Wikipedia. Explicit coordination is measured through talk page activity, while implicit coordination is measured using gini coefficient. Finds that both forms contribute to quality in the early stages of an article, and that crowd size helps quality under implicit coordination but hurts it under explicit coordination. (Measures effects over a fixed period of time, so measures progress rather than outcome.) 890 articles for two 6 month periods, 22729 for one. Lagged multiple regression for causality (cohen et al) and Heckman 2-step.
(How can group structure be chosen for a small amount of explicit coordination and a large amount of implicit coordination?)
Brook's law
40\% of edits are indirect work. (he says she says). Featured articles have more editors, even adjusting for size (Assessing the value of cooperation in wikipedia, wilkinson et al).
"Editors can also implicitly coordinate in Wikipedia, either by playing a leadership role in setting the direction and scope of an article, providing a framework to integrate the work of less involved editors, or by taking on tasks that would otherwise require high coordination between contributors." Shared mental model.
(Coordination relates to interdependence. Core-periphery structure and implicit coordination?)
Coordination through mutual adjustment (march \& simon). (Connects social learning to org theory).

Networks of human subjects perform remarkably well at solving complex problems. One exception: self-organized network. (Although network was self-organized over a short time scale.)
Network structure matters, but is task-dependent.
Some players develop signalling methods to communicate.
Graph coloring. Cycles performed poorly, but were much improved by adding chords. However, dense PE networks did not perform as well.
Coordination. Groups. In complex networks, giving global view degraded performance.
Consensus / Coloring: rewiring helps consensus but hurts coloring.
Bargaining experiment. Behavior more equal than equilibrium. Stubbornness results in unclosed deals that lower total payoff.
Independent set. Kings/pawns. Allowing one-sided payments increased social welfare.
Biased voting. Well-connected minority can influence entire network.
Self-organized networks had highly skewed distributions. "There was effectively more reliance on a small number of high-centrality vertices or players, making performance less robust to stubbornness or other non-cooperating behaviors."

Weak ties connect otherwise distant parts of network, enabling spread of information/disease. Simple contagion. Complex contagions require multiple exposures, which are unlikely to occur over long/weak ties. "For complex contagions, long ties can be weak in both of Granovetter's meanings, structural as well as relational." Simple contagions allow herding. Simple contagions depend only on span, complex also on width. Width is number of ties between intersection of two communities and rest of community.
Reasons for complex contagion: 1. strategic complementarity, 2. credibility, 3. legitimacy, 4. emotional contagion.
Multiple exposures vs multiple sources. Independence. (Compare to generated and interpreted).
Small worlds. (Watts \& Strogatz, 1998) Critical threshold: with enough randomization, complex contagions cannot spread. Can spread faster on a highly clustered small world (between ordered and random).
Collective behavior thresholds (Granovetter, 1978) (Schelling, 2006). "Social movements spread over spatial networks." "Participation spreads most effectively in populations that are spatially clustered" Long ties can be beneficial for coordination, but wide ties are necessary in high-risk situations.

1 Non-hierarchicalism
Multiple forms conflated. Condensation symbol. Need more precise semantics.
Mechanisms: replication, federation, subsidiarity. Control: access, evolution, vision. Analytical lenses: technical capabilities, rules and protocols, exclusive meanings, structural inequalities.
Decentralization in one dimension implies centralization in another.
Zooko's triangle: uniqueness, human-meaningful, decentralized.
2 Consensus
Affinity consensus: small groups.
Types:
corporate (nemawashi): consensus-building informally before formal decision-making.
scientific: preponderance of agreement among researchers
standards: non-binding agreement between stakeholders
factional: well-defined factions, all have veto power
mob: unstructured, flocking
assembly: formal, open membership. veto power diminishes with size
affinity: small, closed membership, all have veto
cornell: agreement, participation, non-conflict
Graeber, no experience with direct democracy in US. Similar to Putnam's Bowling Alone.
Consensus necessary only when resources are scarce. (Could neoliberal democracy achieve this?)
Interesting distinction between consensus decision-making process and consensus-building. I hope to bridge the two.
3 Computer-aided decision-making
Mcgrath's tasks: generate, choose, negotiate, execute. Axes: conflict/cooperate, conceptul/practical.
Mcgrath: methods: obtrusive/unobtrusive, general/specific. E.g. Field study vs theory vs simulation.
Groupware, forums+voting, large-scale digital democracy.
4 Design of Intertwinkles
Use of games to identify and encourage thinking about practices.
Iterations: independent tools, central group server and independent app servers, central server with plugins.
Need for group service.
5 Field Trial and Evaluation
Often used between meetings. (Maybe good for building consensus?)

Describes two types of signals: generated and interpreted. Generated are samples from a distribution. Interpreted are based on independent subsets of attributes. Generated are uncorrelated, while interpreted are negatively correlated (conditioned on at least one outcome). Interpreted signals depend on perspective and heuristics. Generated signals are unlimited in number, while interpreted are limited.
Diversity. For interpreted signals, negatively correlated agents can improve group performance.
Example: restaurant meals vs. restaurant location/prices.
Task structure. With interpreted signals, the number of signals depends on the number of attributes.}

Argues that emphasis on structureless and leaderless groups is misguided, that all groups have structure whether formal or informal and hidden. Discusses the concept of an elite group of friends who exert control over a larger group.
Collective action
Achieve specific ends.
Structure
"If the movement is to grow eyond these elementary stages of development, it will have to disabuse itself of some of its prejudices about organization and structure."
Structurelessness masks power. Participation can only be open if structure is explicit.
(Structure does not imply hierarchy).
Without structure: 1." people listen to others because they like them, not because they say significant things." 2. "no obligation to be responsible to the group at large"
To achieve goals without structure: 1. task-oriented, 2. relatively small and homogeneous, 3. high degree of communication, 4. low degree of skill specialization.
"Information must be passed on to everyone, opinions checked, work divided up, and participation assured in the relevant decisions. This is only possible if the group is small and people practically live together for the most crucial phases of the task. Needless to say, the number of interactions necessary to involve everybody increases geometrically with the number of participants. This inevitably limits group participants to about five, or excludes some from some of the decisions. Successful groups can be as large as 10 or 15, but only when they are in fact composed of several smaller subgroups which perform specific parts of the task, and whose members overlap with each other so that knowledge of what the different subgroups are doing can be passed around easily."
"Avowedly Unstructured groups have no way of drawing upon the movement's vast resources to support its priorities. It doesn't even have a way of deciding what they are."
Democratic principles: 1. Delegation of specific authority-individual-task. 2. Responsibility to selectors 3. Distribution of authority 4. Rotation of tasks. 5. Allocation of tasks along rational criteria. 6. Diffusion of information to everyone. 7. Equal access to resources.
Groups
Elites are groups of friends involved in the same political activities. (Isolated community in both friendship and organizational network).
Some groups have more than one elite group, possibly overlapping (factions). Argues that two is healthiest as they can compete with larger group as arbiter. (Limited view of possibilities.)
Conflict
Subgroup membership often influenced by access to resources and long-term kinship relationships (marriage).
Other possible requirements: "middle-class background (despite all the rhetoric about relating to the working class); being married; not being married but living with someone; being or pretending to be a lesbian; being between the ages of twenty and thirty; being college educated or at least having some college background; being "hip"; not being too "hip"; holding a certain political line or identification as a "radical"; having children or at least liking them; not having children; having certain "feminine" personality characteristics such as being "nice"; dressing right (whether in the traditional style or the antitraditional style)"
Disqualifiers: "being too old; working full time, particularly if one is actively committed to a "career"; not being "nice"; and being avowedly single (i.e., neither actively heterosexual nor homosexual)"
Recruit members who "fit in"
Bringing differences in opinion into view can expose informal structure.
Decision-making
Group opinion: vote, survey, spokespeople. External can seek spokespeople even if none exist. (Deliberation can surface group opinion).
"When an informal network spreads new ideas and information among themselves outside the group, they are already engaged in the process of forming an opinion"

Argues that egalitarian human societies may be product of intentional "leveling mechanisms" used to keep aggressive and dominating individuals in check. Based on survey of ethnographies across South America, Africa, Australia. Focused on intentional.
"believe that as of 40,000 years ago, with the advent of anatomically modern humans who continued to live in small groups and had not yet domesticated plants and animals, it is very likely that all human societies practiced egalitarian behavior and that most of the time they did so very successfully.
Great apes as well as human chiefdoms, kingdoms, states have marked dominance hierarchies. (Not true of Bonobos.) Human societies of few hundred or smaller often live as equals. Why?
Mechanisms
Public opinion. Criticism and ridicule. Disobedience. Extreme sanctions (including violence and execution, often associated with witchcraft and sorcery).
Community vs individual.
Roles
Some groups have war and peace chiefs.
Non-hierarchical
Ambivalence. "First among equals." Dominance within family (gender, marital status, etc.)
Group size
"Egalitarian behavior ensures that leadership will be weak and, as a side effect, that fission will take place readily and communities will remain small."},

Between 2011 and 2014, the German Pirate Party used delegative democracy to make decisions. This form of decision-making was enabled by the LiquidFeedback software platform. Delegative democracy is sometimes criticized for enabling super-voters, who have large amounts of power. This paper finds that while super-voters exist, they often vote in accordance with the existing majority. This paper also takes advantage of the detailed record of voting information to evaluate political power indexes and define new indexes that better reflect the exercise of power in the data set. The most accurate indexes assume that voters have a homogeneous probability of voting yes on particular instances, but that this probability differs from instance to instance.}

Compares Condorcet Jury Theorem, Diversity Trumps Ability, and Dewey's experimentalist model as epistemic models of democracy. Argues that Dewey's model is more representative.
Social Learning and Org Theroy
Institutional epistomology: "do institutions of a particular type have the ability to gather and make effective use of the information they need to solve a particular problem?.)
Decentralization
Centralization cannot solve widely dispersed information problems (Hayek 1945). Votes, talk, markets. Markets for private concerns, votes and talk for public. Widely held private interests are still not public.
Democracy
1. public interest. 2. joint action. 3. law (cooperation, maybe coercion). Approval legitimizes. Epistemic focus on the right decision based on external criteria.
Condorcet
Requires homogeneity. Requires independence, in contrast to talk. Ignores dynamics: effect may be unanticipated.
DTA
Addresses universal inclusion instrumentally, but ignores that it is necessary to be democratic. Does not consider feedback (elections, etc.)
Dewey
Democracy as social intelligence (collective intelligence, social learning).
Groups
Importance of cross-cutting communities.
Dissent
Draws attention to diverse information and strategies. Mutual accommodation. Argues consensus means no objections. (For consensus, not necessary to agree, but to be listened to). Urgency quashes dissent, leads to coercion. (Performance efficiency trade-off). "Dissent prior to decision-making is a necessary condition for the formation of a genuinely collective will consistent with the autonomy of each member." Ensures that decision-making is deliberative.
Case study: community forestry groups in India and Nepal.
Barrier to participation: sexism. Caucusing and critical mass.

Interviews and participant observation of Wikipedia. Argues the site has become increasingly decentralized both in terms of content and policy. Started with long-standing central editors. Contacted other editors based on common themes that arose.
Frameworks: Lessig 1. law 2. norms 3. market 4. tech. Elinor Ostrom.
Importance of norms for cooperation. Importance of deliberation for norms.
Distinction between technical access and social power. Unregistered users can't form social connections.
Decentralization
Demarcation between core and periphery, according to Wales and editors. (this seems more like centralization to me). Public and private email lists and irc servers. Groups. Leaders support is more of a culmination of community discussion.Admins are trusted, but don't have power. Similar to Boehm's lead among equals.
Enforcement decentralized from Wales to ArbCom to admins. (Again, orthodox hierarchy, not really decentralized). Old admin commented they might not be able to pass newer requirements. Iron law. Enforcement is at discretion of the community.
Groups
As site has grown, it has split into many small communities. Self-select into small sub-groups. Idealogical, functional, content-related (overlapping). (Unlike societies, multiple communities can share the same resource.) Communities are a superset of site-wide norms, requiring site norms to be flexible.
Efficiency
policy changes more slowly. Is solidified by use. Consensus is harder, so more formal.},

Higher status projects show more implicit coordination through unequal work distribution, as measured by x-core, corroborating Kittur \& Kraut 2008. Coordination is higher in crowded projects. Also modeled numerically and analytically to show coordination is desirable for crowded and undesirable for non-crowded.

Discusses polycentric approaches to governing common-pool resources and reviews related frameworks, theories, and models. Highlights the importance of fitting institutional rules to a specific social-ecological setting.
Types of goods
Samuelson: pure private (excludable, rivalrous), public (non-excludable, nonrivalrous).
Club goods / toll goods (buchanan): excludable, non-rivalrous
Common pool: non-excludable, rivalrous
Variables impacting likelihood of self-organization: size; productivity; predictability; mobility; collective choice rules; user number; leadership; knowledge about SES; importance of SES
Polycentric
"Polycentric" connotes many centers of decision making that are formally independent of each other. Whether they actually function independently, or instead constitute an interdependent system of relations, is an empirical question in particular cases. To the extent that they take each other into account in competitive relationships, enter into vari ous contractual and cooperative undertakings or have recourse to central mechanisms to resolve conflicts, the various political jurisdictions in a metropolitan area may function in a coherent manner with consistent and predictable patterns of interacting behavior. To the extent that this is so, they may be said to function as a "system." (V. Ostrom, Tiebout, and Warren 1961: 831-32)
Studies of water and police found that multiple governmental units without a hierarchy could function productively. Taking advantage of economies of scale while avoiding diseconomies. Mechanisms: 1. small to medium sized cities are more effective at monitoring performance 2. citizens who are dissatisfied can vote with their feet 3. local incorporated communities can contract with larger producers.
Same with irrigation (Wai Fung Lam 1998)
Rational choice model assumes single government imposing restrictions to resolve dilemmas by changing incentives (Sugden). Ignores communication and agency of participants.
RC applies when individuals do not know each other, cannot communicate. Ostrom, Gardner, Walker 1994
Trust increases productivity (Arrow 1974)
Frameworks vs Theories vs Models
Institutional Analysis Framework
External variables, action situations, interactions, evaluative criteria, outcomes.
Components of theory of behavior. Heuristics, norms (meta-norms, fairness and justice), communication.
Microsituational
1. communication feasible with all participants 2. reputations are known 3. high marginal per capita return 4. entry/exit 5. Longer time horizon 6. Agreed-upon sanctioning.
(Longer time horizon could correspond to lower degree social network: more interactions per person)
Quotes
"Complexity is not the same as chaos in regard to metropolitan governance."
"observed behavior may vary by context because the perception of the 'right thing' would change" (Oliveira, Croson, Eckel 2009)
"A core goal of public policy should be to facilitate the development of institutions that bring out the best in humans."}

Describes a formal spatial model of elections, incorporating candidates platform choice, and voter abstention. Model is highly abstract and idealized, but used to understand possible consequences of specific assumptions.
Model basis
Simplest spatial models operate on a single dimension, assume perfect information, and allow candidates to choose any location. Goal is to find dominant position: position that is preferable for all moves by other candidates.
For single-peaked preferences in one dimension, median is dominant (compare to Lee-Goel). Otherwise, dominant strategy may not exist. Strategy can depend on order of choosing (path dependence). Paradox can also arise from multiple dimensions, even if each demension would have a dominant strategy when taken by itself.
Example of Arrow: ACB, CBA, BAC
Winning criteria: Dominant strategy.
"Political lore, empirical generalizations, or simple graphic arguments are not satisfactory for understanding the political process."
Current model
1. evaluate position, decide whether to vote or abstain.
Assumptions: 1. dimensions are continuous 2. voters have preference for each dimension 3. voters have same indeces 4. candidates have perfect spatial mobility 5. weights assumed common to all voters (misses selective indifference) or variations in concern do not correlate with preference. 6. Citizen votes for preferred candidate
Voters estimate candidates position in space. Assumption: all citizens make identical assumptions.
Individual loss functions, minimum at ideal point, increasing away from point. Possibility, quadratic form with L2 loss, (contrast with NK model). (Quadratic form forms a network of interactions between dimensions. How does this network compare to Salganik's matrix? How do these preference networks relate to social networks?)
Marginally increasing/decreasing loss.
Multiple peaks in one dimension suggest "multiple standards".
Elections often influenced by voter turnout.
Utility determining abstention: R = PB + D - C. P is probability of influencing outcome, B is value of outcome. Can abstain due to indifference or alienation.
Moderate candidates can be effective at shifting extreme candidates.
Many dimensions: mean position best.
Mean is dominant when f(x) symmetric and loss is marginally increasing. Or f(x) symmetric unimodal and L marginally increasing+decreasing.
Two density case (political parties)
Greater distance benefits majority. Dispersion of majority can allow minority to win.
"Our model, like Arrow's, should not be interprted as a description of the electoral process, but as an abstraction of characteristics which seem fundamental and pervasive in electoral processes."
"Second, an assumption's sutability may be disputed because of a confusion between the properties of an adequate theory and the properties of a description of reality in terms of the theory."},

An {\textbackslash}eps-approximate ranking is one such that changing no more than {\textbackslash}eps fraction of comparisons for each individual could produce the true ranking. A 1-{\textbackslash}eps Borda or Condorcet winner have a Borda score within a 1-{\textbackslash}eps fraction of the true winner, or win 1-{\textbackslash}eps fraction of pairwise comparisons. The paper presents proofs that random sampling can be used to elicit these approximate winners much more efficiently than the true winners. The authors note the caveat that these algorithms produce approximate winners only with high probability, and only if sampling is uniform. The algorithms do not produce enough information to prove whether the uncovered winners are truly 1-{\textbackslash}eps winners, and non-uniform sampling could be used to deliberately generate false winners.
In empirical testing, the authors were able to find a 005 Borda winner with an average of less than two comparisons per participant.}

Motivated by the internet, this paper describes a randomized voting algorithm which uses local consensus to choose a winner in a vote with many candidates. When preferences are one-dimensional and single-peaked, a Condorcet winner is guaranteed and the presented algorithm converges approximately to the Condorcet winner WHP. Finds a (1 - {\textbackslash}eps/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}) approximation with communication complexity of O(n log{\textasciicircum}2 n), conjectured to be n log n. In the algorithm, triplets of voters are chosen at random and each is asked to vote for one of the other two. All are relabeled with the winning preference until there is one left.
The algorithm presented is a concrete example of large-scale preference aggregation. The formalism suggests that a generalized median can be used when proposals exist in an abstract space. The question of how real decisions can be mapped into points of an abstract space is left unanswered.}

Details a new method of wiki surveys and related case studies. Traditional methods are either limited (quantitative) or difficult to analyze (qualitative). Wiki surveys attempt to provide an intermediate approach.
When answers provided in open form, as many as 60\% were not in the original closed form set (Schuman \& Presser).
Greedy: collect as much info as respondents willing to provide. Collaborative: new information contributed by respondents. Adaptive: instrument optimized based on information collected so far.
Pairwise surveys. Two options or add new. (Contrast to Lee \& Goel triads) Granular: small contributions, modular: can be aggregated.
Case studies:
AllOurIdeas: 6000 pairwise surveys, 300k items, 7m responses. NYC \& OECD. (Can I get data?)
Estimate opinion matrix (p[respondent chooses proposal). Affiliation network. Stronger than preference. Estimated using Thurstone Mosteller.
Results
Exactly 10 responses would eliminate 75\% of responses. Large number of novel proposals. Most popular are novel ideas and alternative framings.
Discusses that gold-standards don't exist for preference data. (This is what I want to measure better.) In some cases, preferences are the ground truth.},

This work presents several results about consensus when opinions can be represented as points on a metric space or median graph. Rather than focusing entirely on voting and preference aggregation, the authors consider the deliberative process using a formalized model. Results use the concept of a generalized median over graphs or Rn. Results apply both to opinion formation and strategic bargaining.
One result shows that when a Condorcet winner exists, it will coincide with the generalized median. The proof uses the concept of gateway nodes, which connect an external point to all points of a convex hull via shortest paths. The authors note a related result that even when no Condorcet winner exists, participants can still converge to a central point.
Is the nested clique a median graph? What do the basins of attraction of two neighboring nodes look like on a nested clique?
The paper also shows that pairwise interactions cannot find an approximation of the generalized median, while triadic interactions can find one quickly. This result is subject to a consistency constraint formalized in terms of the convex hull in opinion space.
The paper refers to median graphs, but does not explain how the nodes and edges of such graphs relate to opinions. Since the l1 norm is used, a lattice of points in Rn would form a median graph, but the results should hold in an arbitrary median graph with a metric distance. When using median graphs, only opinions initially held by some participant can be found, limiting the ability for creativity and compromise. How can these be incorporated? Also, do opinions really exist on a metric space?}

Examines relationship between crowd size, crowd composition (diversity/experience), retention, and performance in 4317 WikiProject Film articles. Crowds allow contributions from many people, but its unclear when they improve outcomes. Crowds can increase available resources, but also coordination costs. Find that more experienced and diverse crowds can better leverage increases in size for better performance.
Direct: correlation. Indirect: correlation through another variable. Contingency: interaction. Contingency studies suggest relationship between crowd size and performance is dependent on other variables.
Lack of retention has decreased number of active contributors on wikipedia.
Model: diversity/experience influences both size-retention and size-performance. Retention also influences performance. Local workload diversity (in article) vs global workload diversity (across community).
Low retention can be a filtering mechanism.
Performance: size-performance positive for high LWD, GWD, interest diversity. Experience greater with large crowds. Size-performance positive for low retention.
Retention: size-retention positive high GWD, interest diversity. size-retention negative for high LWD (iron law?)

Olson's zero contribution thesis argues that cooperation in public goods settings is only possible in small groups or with coercion. This paper argues that evolutionary explanations can reconcile observed cooperation with economic models.
Public goods
Free riding.
Models
Linear public goods. Rational egoists have unique equilibrium of contributing zero.
Evolutionary model
Conditional cooperators. Willing punishers.
Humans have domain-specific problem-solving systems. Deontic vs empirical. Deontic system results in norms, guilt, shame. Indirect evolutionary model: alter utility based on payoff.
Experiment
With greater numbers of rounds, cooperation increases. Face-to-face also increases cooperation. External rules reduce cooperation.
Cooperation factors
type of production and allocation functions; the predictability of resource flows; the relative scarcity of the good; the size of the group involved; the heterogeneity of the group; the dependence of the group on the good; common understanding of the group; the size of the total collective benefit; the marginal contribution by one person to the collective good; the size of the temptation to free ride; the loss to cooperators when others do not cooperate; having a choice of participating or not; the presence of leadership; past experience and level of social capital; the autonomy to make binding rules; and a wide diversity of rules that are used to change the structure of the situation
Evolution
Core group can cooperate and establish norms, especially if a leader is present. Clear group boundaries help establish trust.
Design-principles of long-surviving, self-organized resource regimes
1. Boundaries (Internet makes easier)
2. Rules: inputs, how much, when, how, local importance
3. Most of those effected able to participate in rule-making
4. Select own monitors, accountable to users
5. Graduated sanctions (quasi-voluntary cooperation)
6. Rapid, low-cost conflict resolution
7. Right to organize
8. (For larger resources) multiple layers of governance
Threats to sustained collective action
In/out-migration.
Government imposition of single set of rules.
Changes in technology.
Transmission failure between generations.
Turning to external sources for help too frequently.
International aid
Corruption
Conflicts between regimes.

Discusses the society of Yir Yoront people in Australia. Social obligations are dictated by kinship relations and age. Kinship groups are geographically and linguistically dispersed. Opposed to previous characterizations (Murdock) of {\textless}1500 person local groups.
Live at subsistence. (Thought, surplus can be used to increase population or to increase inequality.)
Societies
"where there are subgroups that are discrete entitites within the social entirety, there is political organization--a system of regulation of relations between groups or members of different groups within society at large." -Hoebel
Redfield defines politics as "institutions to express or enforce the common will or the ruler's will formally and publicly."
Overlapping groups
Individuals range, and neighbors at any particular time have "essentially different interaction networks."
Yir Yoront changed language while maintaining social affiliations.
"The cutting lines for societies or communities are nowhere cleare, and everywhere there is flux or overlap of people with their mutually understood but different behaviors."
Named patrilineal totemic clan. Holds land, thousands of small named countries associated with clans through mythology and ancestors. Countries (possibly from different clans) are organized into tracts. (Multi-layer network). Kinship grants rights to use land belonging to another clan. Mutual dependence is key.
Non-hierarchy
28 kinship roles (14 same-gender, 14 cross-gender). Also non-kinship role of curer (masculine).
"Ego receives women and thankfully and respectfully gives goods and services in return, and he gives women (his sister to his father's sister's son, his daughter to his sister's son) and in return cheerfully receives goods and services comparable to those he himself must provide to his wife's or his mother's family."
"There are five other types of male kin to whom Ego acts as the first five act to him, in a superordinate way, although the roles in relation to each are different. In playing these ten different roles, Ego is in a strong position in five of them and in a weak position in five of them."
Ego subordinate to father and older brother. Son's sons are belong to the same kinship class as older brothers. (Cyclic dependence!)
"A man has no dealing with another man (or woman, either) on exactly equal terms. And where each is at the same time in relatively weak positions and in an equal number of relatively strong positions, no one can be either absolutely strong or absolutely weak. A hierarchy of a pyramidal or inverted-Y type to include all the men in the system is impossible."
Leaders are those lacking subordinate relationships due to circumstance and age. "Malevolent levels of the kinship roles serve a kind of legal or police function"
"In the Yir Yoront we find a people having an open social system, of which each individual is the center of his own universe of interaction."
Claims kinship roles are not coached. (Age based roles allow learning by observation.)},

Considers whether Mardujarra people in Australia are egalitarian or "delayed-return" society.
Hunter-gatherer attributes: mobility over wide areas; restricted group size; flexible structures that accommodate variability in resources; a lack of material wealth; rules for reciprocal access to resources; an immediate and direct relation between production and consumption; a steady rhythm of work and leisure; food-sharing based on generalised reciprocity; and non-exclusivity in ownership and use of land.
"Tribal-level" attributes: number, complexity and cultural importance of sodalities which are interposed between the band and the society as a whole.
Egalitarian: hunter-gatherer with immediate return. Immediate and direct returns on food-getting labor; labile social groupings; a high level of choice concerning 'co-residents'; a lack of dependence on specific others for access to basic resources; interpersonal relationships based on mutuality rather than long-term commitments and dependencies; and the systematic elimination of distinctions (other than those between the sexes) of wealth, power and status. (Woodburn)
Mardujarra are dependent on groups rather than specific people. Flow of valuables is two-way. Greatest obligation is to "the Law."
Selection of circumciser made to maintain symmetrical relations, rather than exploit inequalities.
Non-hierarchy
"The system as a whole balances symmetries of expected interpersonal behavior with asymmetries, such that no individuals are in a position in the network which accords them a kinship status elevating them above most others."
Egalitarian mindset possibly driven by unpredictability of drought.
Conflict
Shame, ridicule, physical violence, threat of sorcery.}

Wikis
History. No permanent damage caused by bad editing. Encourages introspection. Watchlists provide surveillance (awareness?) Talk pages for meta-discussion. Community agreement on NPOV.
History Flow
Content colored by author. Horizontal axis represents time, vertical represents content length
Patterns: vandalism and repair, anonymity versus named authorship, negotiation (edit-wars), content stability.
Early editors set the tone and are more likely to have their content remain. (Compare with Shaw\&Hill, iron law).}

Two types of model: 1. predictive, postulates leading to theorems (Ostrom's meaning) 2. descriptive, definitions, not by themselves falsifiable (Ostrom's framework).
Brokers: articulation point (graph theory), liason (sociology). Bridge (graph theory), critical communication channel (soc).
Hierarchy. Konig's theorem: trees have one or two points with minimal "associated number". Can be translated to social setting.
Societies. Kinship and marriage (prohibitions on incest). Also "marriage types." Graph theory can be used to determine permissible marriages and to relate socialogical statements to theorems.
Social balance (Heider 1946, Newcomb 1953, 1956). Attitude of two individuals towards each other influenced by attitudes towards third object (or person). Signed 3-cycles, multiplication of signs must be positive. Groups tend to split into two subgroups.
Hierarchy. Influcence, win, preferred. Pecking order or peck-right. Landau's hierarchy index (1951). Under random models, social ability can't account for hierarchy, need social factors. (Should be able to identfy social factors).

1. Don't rock the boat. 2. Be provocable 3. Accept an apology 4. Forget 5. Accept a rut
Most do well except for with "adjuster" strategy, just like tit for tat. Median rule does better than tit for tat. Good at highly specialized adaptations to specific environments. Decreased performance due to decreased cooperation, followed by increase in both due to ability to discriminate (trust).

Norms allow a player to punish others for defecting, at costs to both players. Strategies can be characterized by varying levels of boldness and vengefulness. Metanorms allow convergence to a low-boldness state.
Civil rights and liberties are protected by norms as much as law.
"Across many nations, tolerance of opposition is a fragile norm that has a great impact on whether a democracy can survive in a given country." (Almondand Verba, Dahl)
Norms
Coordinated behavior in the absence of central control is often attributed to norms.
"A norm exists in a given social setting to the extent that individuals usually act in a certain way and are often punished when seen not to be acting in this way."
Rather than rational choice, real people are likely to use trial-and-error. Genetic algorithms (Holland)
Norms Game, various behavior. Fall in boldness, fall in vengefulness, rise in boldness. Norms game with metanorms. Converges to low boldness high vengefulness.
Mechanisms.
1. Metanorms.
2. Dominance (different payoffs, different numbers). Low V, high B without metanorms, but with metanorms easy for strong group to punish weak but not vice versa.
3. Internalization (e.g. guilt)
"An increased incentive to punish, through internalization or by some other means, would lead some people to feel a gain from punishing a defector. For them, the payoff from enforcement, E, would actually be positive. Such people are often known as self-righteous busybodies and often are not very well liked by those who enjoy a defection now and then."
4. Deterrence
5. Social Proof (Cialdini) (Important implications for visibility as in Wikipedia or in societies with rituals)
6. Membership. 1. Direct effect on utility with voluntary membership. 2. Like-minded people interact. 3. Defining group defines expected behavior.
7. Law. Supplements private enforcement. Power of its own. Adds clarity.
8. Reputation. Actions signal future behavior.
Norms of partiality support powerful (Ullman-Margalit).
"Because norms sometimes become established surprisingly quickly, there may be some useful cooperative norms that could be hurried along with relatively modest interventions."}

Discusses how communication in an organization relates to design of systems.
Personal motivations can subvert stakeholder goals.
Stages: 1. Boundaries 2. Preliminary organization and group assignment.
"Given any design team organization, there is a class of design alternatives which cannot be effectively pursued by such an organization because the necessary communication paths do not exist." (What types of designs do hierarchical management rule out?)
Lifecycle: 1. Boundaries, 2. Preliminary system concept, 3. Delegation, 4. Coordination among tasks, 5. Consolidation. (Relate to framework, collective action can be recursive).
Systems are designed as interconnected subsystems. (Scalar hierarchy).
System-committee, subsystem-subcommittee, interface-coordinator. (Coordinator could be protocol or same individual with multiple membership, relate to DeTar).
Motivation: System management and disintigration. 1. Too many people, 2. conventional (hierarchical) management causes communication to disintigrate, 3. System reflects communication disintegration.
Motivation: "Research which leads to techniques permitting more efficient communication among designers will play an extremely important role in the technology of system management."
"Organizations which design systems (in the broad sense used here) are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."}

Includes "trembling hand." Similar to crossing-over in genetic algorithms. Causes edge effects, making optima near the edge hard to find.

Simulations find that the role of social influence in consensus depends on both network structure and task type. Close-minded: connectivity helps. Open-minded: connectivity good for consensus but bad for correctness, must balance with regularity.
"Consensus, to be productive, requires that each individual contribute independently out of his experience and insight. When consensus comes under the dominance of conformity, the social process is polluted and the individual at the same time surrenders the powers on which his functioning as a feeling and and thinking being depends." (Asch 1955)
Previous work on binary decisions (Zollman 2007, 2009, 2010a) finds that social influence can be harmful when testing different options (search, generation).
Types of consensus: mere consensus, correct consensus.
Linear pooling (French 1956). If individuals are equally reliable, graph should be regular.
Bounded confidence (Abelson 1964, Friedkin and Johnson 1999). Spatial models. Influenced only by close opinions. Complete at most 1/delta groups, ring as many as nodes.
"central individuals might create consensus by influencing everyone else to take their positions. While central individuals might help to create consensus, they might do so by making the group as a whole less reliable."
Trust. Increasing contact most beneficial when groups are moderately open-minded. When closed minded, having a central individual helps bridge without negatively skewing outcome.}

Equates width/depth with representation/argumentation. Simple model uses width/depth, refined model uses PCA. Similar results for both.
Digital Democracy. Internet can overcome censorship for wider participation. Can amplify preferences and polarize, or can build consensus.
Deliberative theory. Conditions include equality of all participants, representativeness of arguments. "Deliberation is based on social interactions between heterogenous individuals that are able to revise their preferences in the light of the arguments defended by others." Preferences are transformed rather than aggregated. (Habermas 1984, 1987). "Strong democracy" replaces representation with participation (Pateman. Cohen. Fishkin. Barber). Procedural / consequentialist (Landa and Meirowitz 2009). Polarization (Schkade et al 2007).

Review of organizational psychology research on teams performing many types of tasks finds that groups typically perform better than individuals, while taking longer to find a solution. However, except in a few cases, statistical aggregates or high skilled individuals perform at least as well as groups. Exceptions were for complex tasks like crossword puzzles which no individual could solve on their own.
Provides framework for discussing individual and group performance.
Interpersonal context: isolated, coacting, dispersed.
Performance score: individual, best member, pooled,complex, group product.
(Can use these to describe collective intelligence vs wisdom of crowds)
(Two types of collaboration: async/one-shot vs sync/repeated)
tasks: learning, mastery/creativity, abstract problem solving, brainstorming, complex problem solving.
Learning: multiple sources of random error leads to error correction. Qualitatively different learning strategies. Groups, fewer choices and errors than individuals, but more time. Same as best members. No group members were reliably better (similar to HP2004). Group also influenced stronger sense of success, personal causation.
Mastery/creativity. Heterogeneous groups, performance sum of individuals.
Problem solving. Complex problems involving synthesis, group better than sum of individual. Pooling and integration necessary. Process loss may be due to centralization.
Brainstorming. Statistical pooling performed better than group. Simultaneous division of labor helps. Production blocking hurts in groups.
Complex problems. (more than one, or subjective answer). Group performance better than individual but worse than pooling. Groups hindered by truth-wins strategy. (Seems to be conformity, clique is efficient network, counter to BG2017). Individual solutions were superior for short timescales (faster convergence). Best ideas were not always incorporated.
Training and practice had mixed effects.
Risk. More willing to take risks for others, less willing to tolerate risk decided by others.
Social loafing.
Gender interacts with group dynamics.
(Assumption that group size has linear effect seems unrealistic.)
Process loss (Steiner 1972)
Process gain from capacity to learn from each other.
"This research confirms the belief that the performance of one exceptional individual can be superior to that of a committee (Davis, 1969rb), especially if th ecommittee is trying to solve a complex problem and if the committee contains a number of low-ability members." Contrast}

Presents commons-based peer production as an alternative to markets, firms, and states. Uses examples including NASA click workers, Wikipedia, Kuro5hin, Google search, Slashdot.
Challenges are motivation and organization (coordination). Advantages are that individuals make decisions about the resources they have access to, with peer review and quality control. Also allows larger groups with access to more resources.
New type of organization arising because of low cost communication and storage. Creativity is now the scarce resource (also attention).
Motivation. "there exist ranges of human experience in which the presence of monetary rewards is inversely related to the presence of other, social-psychological rewards." Examples: sex, marriage, dinner party. (All involve building social bonds, money is meant to break social bonds). Decomposability. If tasks can be broken up into small pieces, required motivation is small. Allows asynchronous collaboration between individuals (or small groups). Heterogeneous granularity allows individuals to work at appropriate level. Low-cost integration and quality control are necessary.
Peer production
1. Utterance 2. accreditation 3. distribution.
Content. Boundaries (like Ostrom) are defined by Wikipedia policies. Kuro5hin has guidelines for quality control.
Accreditation. Can accreditation be peer-produced? Yes. Slashdot Karma.
II Peer production in networked environment.
Theoretical space: Ronald Coase "The Nature of the Firm" and Demsetz "Toward a theory of property rights". Arises when peering more efficient than market based solution and opportunity cost of property regime outweighs benefits.
Networked environment. Information is purely nonrival (yes, but attention is not). Low capital cost of production. Creative talent is variable, making allocation an important and difficult task.
Information processing. Claims that for some tasks, peer production is more efficient than markets or firms. Information gains. Agents act when they believe the value of an outcome to be greater than the effort/resources. Also depends on valuation by other agents: uncertainty. (Connect to framework). Interdependence creates uncertainty (depending on trust). Hierarchy is lossy medium.
"the primary source of gains-which may be called information gains-that peer production offers is its capacity to collect and process information about human capital." Intellectual effort highly individuated (like HP2004).
"It is not only, or even primarily, that more people can participate in production. The widely distributed model of information production will better identify who is the est person to produce a specific component of a project, all abilities and availability to work on the speciic module within a specific time frame considered."
Allocation gains. Non-proprietary allows recombination of resources.
III Motivation
Monetary. Intrinsic hedonic. Social-psychological.
"Peer production is limited not by the total cost or complexity of a project, but by its modularity, granularity, and the cost of integration." (Depends on task type and network structure.)
Integration function must be low-cost and/or modular.
Quality control: hierarchical, peer review, norms-based, aggregation/averaging.
On slashdot 90\% of registered users can review moderators, who can review contributions. (Heterarchy)

Empirically shows that deliberation can increase polarization between homogeneous teams.
Homophily means self-organized groups will tend to be homogeneous.
Looked at groups from liberal-leaning Boulder and conservative-leaning Colorado Springs. Issues: global warming, affirmative action, same-sex civil unions.
Conservative groups became more conservative, same for liberal. Members within groups showed more heterogeneity: (functional) diversity decreases. Individuals also showed more extreme views after deliberation.
"Ideological amplification" (Echo chamber)
Evidence for the importance of safeguards for deliberative events.
Convergence reasons: 1. herding (trust, complex contagion). Lack of confidence moves people towards the mean. Corroboration leads to more extreme beliefs. 2. shared information. 3. Social comparison. 4. Movement towards shared identity.
Pre-deliberation median is the best predictor of the movement of individual groups. But Deliberation with majority voting can result in outcomes stronger than the median when homogeneous.
Deliberation between conflicting opinions can have multiple outcomes (Norris \& Englehart)
Administrators, moderators, and leaders can dampen or amplify polarization. (Like SL)
Commitment to a group decision can influence individual preferences.
Polarization can lead a group towards the "right" answer if there is one. (condorcet, hong page)
Deliberating groups do well on eureka problems (task type). Not as well as best members (Gigone Hastie). Not as good for wicked problems.}

Political participation has declined (note Ostrom's participation principle).

Factors allowing pandering to "ignorant and selfish" motivations. Science of public opinion has progressed enough to understand opinions. (Note about 2016 election, Russia, and CA). Scientific marketing has been developed commercially and is being applied to politics. Instead, "improve the character of public opinion itself."
Political knowledge is "appalling." Partly due to "rational ignorance" Anthony Downs (relate to social loafing). Deliberative polling (relate to WikiSurveys) gives incentives to overcome rational ignorance.
Four stages.
1. Randomized 15 person group watches live TV debate on issues. Followed by roundtable discussion with everyone guaranteed at least 5 minutes. Draft question to be discussed in afternoon. Vote by approval.
2. Lunch. Informal conversation and networking. Moderator groups similar questions and selects subset to discuss in the afternoon.
3. Large group meeting. Q/A with party representatives.
4. New, randomized 15 person groups. Share reactions and responses, no votes or substantive conclusions. (Generative but not integrated).

Bridges/Brokers. Structural holes hamper diffusion of information. Bridges and liaison activity are necessary to diffuse across structural holes. Brokers have high betweenness centrality. Control over information flow is a type of power. Constraint. Global brokers (liaison between communities), local brokers (low constraint). Global brokers observed to have more followers, RTs and mentions. Only 10\% of brokers employ hashtags relevant to both movements.

Critiques Habermasian defenses of the Internet as a public sphere on the basis that fragmented publics must be integrated discursively, rather than algorithmically, to be a public sphere.
Habermas (2006) criticized the internet for creating fragmented "isolated issue publics."
Censorhsip. Habermas (2006) recognized that internet can subvert government censorship.
Arguments for the internet as a public sphere assume integration is decentralized, democratic, meritocratic, bottom-up, and radically participatory.
Internet as public sphere addresses two concerns: propaganda (Manufacturing consent) and breakdown of civil life (putnam).
(Internet not *inherently* centerlized, but decentralization is not emergent)
Maltz (1996) argues that the internet enables more people to engage in rational discussion. Research found "some communities were tightly bound by discourse and relations of mutual respect, others were filled with hostility and breakdowns in communication, and most were somewhere in between."
Digital divide, government surveillance, commodification.
Wealth of Networks. networked public sphere. Synthesis of opinion across entire web. Geiger points out not discursive. Synthesis as end in itself, Habermas situates in relation to social integration. Example, automated ranking system.
"Filtering, accredidation, synthesis, and salience are created through a system of peer review by information affinity groups, topical or interest based. These groups filter the observations and opinions of an enormous range of people and transmit those that pass local peer review to broader gorups and ultiately to the polity more broadly." Teams.

Alexis de Toqueville saw civic association as the key to successful democracy in the U.S. Putnam studied sub-national governments in Italy, concluding that despite similarity, differences in government effectiveness were determined by traditions of civic engagement (voting, reading newspapers, social clubs).
Social capital: "features of social organization such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit.
Decline in voter turnout, church attendance, labor union membership, service organizations between 1960 and 1990. "By almost every measure, Americans' direct engagement in politics and government has fallen steadily and sharply over the last generation." Social decapitalization. Less interaction with neighbors, more with friends in other neighborhoods. (long ties).
Explanations: 1. movement of women into the workforce, 2. mobility, 3. demographic transformations (smaller families), 4. technology such as TV.
"What will be the impact ... of electronic networks on social capital? My hunch is that meeting in an electronic forum is not the equivalent of meeting in a bowling alley--or even in a saloon--but hard empirical research is needed."
Trust and civic engagement are strongly correlated, WVS.
Countertrends. "Tertiary associations." Interaction with organization but not other members. Support groups, don't play traditional role due to lack of discourse.}

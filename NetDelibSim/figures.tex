We use the same task parameters as \cite{barkoczi_social_2016} and reproduce their results: the best-neighbor strategy leads to inefficient networks (e.g., lattice) outperforming efficient ones (e.g., complete), while the conform strategy leads to efficient networks outperforming inefficient ones. We find the same result holds in the Network Deliberation setting: the best-neighbor strategy leads to the inefficient long-path group assignment outperforming random group assignment, while the conform strategy leads to the efficient random-group assignment outperforming long-path.}

While the best-neighbor strategy shows comparable performance across all networks, the conform and local majority strategies perform significantly better in both network deliberation settings than in the single-group networks, with conform/random-group matching the best performance of any single-group setting. As with the sampling case, we find that under the best-neighbor strategy, long-path group assignment outperforms random group assignmnt, while under the conform strategy, random group assignment provides the best performance. The local-majority strategy performs similarly in both of the network deliberation settings, landing between the other two strategies.}

Results are similar to Fig. \ref{fig:result-nosample}, but local majority now outperforms conformity for both ND networks. Neither Best Neighbor nor Conform strategy can create a solution outside the basins of attraction already discovered, while Local Majority can. As the number of local maxima becomes much larger than the number of agents, the generative nature of the Local Majority strategy allows it to discover basins of attraction for new local maxima, increasing the probability of finding the global maximum.}

Each bit of each agent's observation has a 40\% chance of being incorrect. Average node degree is 4 (excluding complete network) and no sampling is used. The best-neighbor strategy performs well across all networks and the conform stragey performs poorly across all networks. However, the local majority strategy performs well on the complete network and for network deliberation with random group assignments.}

Argues that egalitarian human societies may be product of intentional "leveling mechanisms" used to keep aggressive and dominating individuals in check. Based on survey of ethnographies across South America, Africa, Australia. Focused on intentional.
"believe that as of 40,000 years ago, with the advent of anatomically modern humans who continued to live in small groups and had not yet domesticated plants and animals, it is very likely that all human societies practiced egalitarian behavior and that most of the time they did so very successfully.
Great apes as well as human chiefdoms, kingdoms, states have marked dominance hierarchies. (Not true of Bonobos.) Human societies of few hundred or smaller often live as equals. Why?
Mechanisms
Public opinion. Criticism and ridicule. Disobedience. Extreme sanctions (including violence and execution, often associated with witchcraft and sorcery).
Community vs individual.
Roles
Some groups have war and peace chiefs.
Non-hierarchical
Ambivalence. "First among equals." Dominance within family (gender, marital status, etc.)
Group size
"Egalitarian behavior ensures that leadership will be weak and, as a side effect, that fission will take place readily and communities will remain small."},

Networks of human subjects perform remarkably well at solving complex problems. One exception: self-organized network. (Although network was self-organized over a short time scale.)
Network structure matters, but is task-dependent.
Some players develop signalling methods to communicate.
Graph coloring. Cycles performed poorly, but were much improved by adding chords. However, dense PE networks did not perform as well.
Coordination. Groups. In complex networks, giving global view degraded performance.
Consensus / Coloring: rewiring helps consensus but hurts coloring.
Bargaining experiment. Behavior more equal than equilibrium. Stubbornness results in unclosed deals that lower total payoff.
Independent set. Kings/pawns. Allowing one-sided payments increased social welfare.
Biased voting. Well-connected minority can influence entire network.
Self-organized networks had highly skewed distributions. "There was effectively more reliance on a small number of high-centrality vertices or players, making performance less robust to stubbornness or other non-cooperating behaviors."

Choice of social learning strategy (conformity vs. best-neighbor) influences effects of network structure and problem complexity on social learning performance. Uses NK model (15, 0 or 15, 7). Uses fully connected network, local lattice, Mason-Watts networks.
In simple environments, both strategies find the optimal solution but best-neighbor converges fastest.
In complex environments, small-sample strategies outperform large-sample. Conformity yielded better long-term outcome, while best member converged faster. Best member: inefficient networks outperform efficient. Conformity: efficient networks outperform inefficient. Attribute to balancing exploration/exploitation.},

Motivated by the internet, this paper describes a randomized voting algorithm which uses local consensus to choose a winner in a vote with many candidates. When preferences are one-dimensional and single-peaked, a Condorcet winner is guaranteed and the presented algorithm converges approximately to the Condorcet winner WHP. Finds a (1 - {\textbackslash}eps/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}) approximation with communication complexity of O(n log{\textasciicircum}2 n), conjectured to be n log n. In the algorithm, triplets of voters are chosen at random and each is asked to vote for one of the other two. All are relabeled with the winning preference until there is one left.
The algorithm presented is a concrete example of large-scale preference aggregation. The formalism suggests that a generalized median can be used when proposals exist in an abstract space. The question of how real decisions can be mapped into points of an abstract space is left unanswered.}

Argues that emphasis on structureless and leaderless groups is misguided, that all groups have structure whether formal or informal and hidden. Discusses the concept of an elite group of friends who exert control over a larger group.
Collective action
Achieve specific ends.
Structure
"If the movement is to grow eyond these elementary stages of development, it will have to disabuse itself of some of its prejudices about organization and structure."
Structurelessness masks power. Participation can only be open if structure is explicit.
(Structure does not imply hierarchy).
Without structure: 1." people listen to others because they like them, not because they say significant things." 2. "no obligation to be responsible to the group at large"
To achieve goals without structure: 1. task-oriented, 2. relatively small and homogeneous, 3. high degree of communication, 4. low degree of skill specialization.
"Information must be passed on to everyone, opinions checked, work divided up, and participation assured in the relevant decisions. This is only possible if the group is small and people practically live together for the most crucial phases of the task. Needless to say, the number of interactions necessary to involve everybody increases geometrically with the number of participants. This inevitably limits group participants to about five, or excludes some from some of the decisions. Successful groups can be as large as 10 or 15, but only when they are in fact composed of several smaller subgroups which perform specific parts of the task, and whose members overlap with each other so that knowledge of what the different subgroups are doing can be passed around easily."
"Avowedly Unstructured groups have no way of drawing upon the movement's vast resources to support its priorities. It doesn't even have a way of deciding what they are."
Democratic principles: 1. Delegation of specific authority-individual-task. 2. Responsibility to selectors 3. Distribution of authority 4. Rotation of tasks. 5. Allocation of tasks along rational criteria. 6. Diffusion of information to everyone. 7. Equal access to resources.
Groups
Elites are groups of friends involved in the same political activities. (Isolated community in both friendship and organizational network).
Some groups have more than one elite group, possibly overlapping (factions). Argues that two is healthiest as they can compete with larger group as arbiter. (Limited view of possibilities.)
Conflict
Subgroup membership often influenced by access to resources and long-term kinship relationships (marriage).
Other possible requirements: "middle-class background (despite all the rhetoric about relating to the working class); being married; not being married but living with someone; being or pretending to be a lesbian; being between the ages of twenty and thirty; being college educated or at least having some college background; being "hip"; not being too "hip"; holding a certain political line or identification as a "radical"; having children or at least liking them; not having children; having certain "feminine" personality characteristics such as being "nice"; dressing right (whether in the traditional style or the antitraditional style)"
Disqualifiers: "being too old; working full time, particularly if one is actively committed to a "career"; not being "nice"; and being avowedly single (i.e., neither actively heterosexual nor homosexual)"
Recruit members who "fit in"
Bringing differences in opinion into view can expose informal structure.
Decision-making
Group opinion: vote, survey, spokespeople. External can seek spokespeople even if none exist. (Deliberation can surface group opinion).
"When an informal network spreads new ideas and information among themselves outside the group, they are already engaged in the process of forming an opinion"

Compares Condorcet Jury Theorem, Diversity Trumps Ability, and Dewey's experimentalist model as epistemic models of democracy. Argues that Dewey's model is more representative.
Social Learning and Org Theroy
Institutional epistomology: "do institutions of a particular type have the ability to gather and make effective use of the information they need to solve a particular problem?.)
Decentralization
Centralization cannot solve widely dispersed information problems (Hayek 1945). Votes, talk, markets. Markets for private concerns, votes and talk for public. Widely held private interests are still not public.
Democracy
1. public interest. 2. joint action. 3. law (cooperation, maybe coercion). Approval legitimizes. Epistemic focus on the right decision based on external criteria.
Condorcet
Requires homogeneity. Requires independence, in contrast to talk. Ignores dynamics: effect may be unanticipated.
DTA
Addresses universal inclusion instrumentally, but ignores that it is necessary to be democratic. Does not consider feedback (elections, etc.)
Dewey
Democracy as social intelligence (collective intelligence, social learning).
Groups
Importance of cross-cutting communities.
Dissent
Draws attention to diverse information and strategies. Mutual accommodation. Argues consensus means no objections. (For consensus, not necessary to agree, but to be listened to). Urgency quashes dissent, leads to coercion. (Performance efficiency trade-off). "Dissent prior to decision-making is a necessary condition for the formation of a genuinely collective will consistent with the autonomy of each member." Ensures that decision-making is deliberative.
Case study: community forestry groups in India and Nepal.
Barrier to participation: sexism. Caucusing and critical mass.

Analyze twitter activity related to two social movements (Indignados and Occupy), finding the communities to be centralized and fragmented, and that potential bridges between the two communities remain unactivated. "Networks afford but do not determine dynamics of information diffusion." (fragmentation may be desirable with certain behavioral strategies).
Bridges/Brokers. Structural holes hamper diffusion of information. Bridges and liaison activity are necessary to diffuse across structural holes. Brokers have high betweenness centrality. Control over information flow is a type of power. Constraint. Global brokers (liaison between communities), local brokers (low constraint). Global brokers observed to have more followers, RTs and mentions. Only 10\% of brokers employ hashtags relevant to both movements.
(Castells, 2009) Four types of power: networking (inclusion/exclusion), network (inclusion rules), networked (within network), network-making (ability to "program" networks).

Olson's zero contribution thesis argues that cooperation in public goods settings is only possible in small groups or with coercion. This paper argues that evolutionary explanations can reconcile observed cooperation with economic models.
Public goods
Free riding.
Models
Linear public goods. Rational egoists have unique equilibrium of contributing zero.
Evolutionary model
Conditional cooperators. Willing punishers.
Humans have domain-specific problem-solving systems. Deontic vs empirical. Deontic system results in norms, guilt, shame. Indirect evolutionary model: alter utility based on payoff.
Experiment
With greater numbers of rounds, cooperation increases. Face-to-face also increases cooperation. External rules reduce cooperation.
Cooperation factors
type of production and allocation functions; the predictability of resource flows; the relative scarcity of the good; the size of the group involved; the heterogeneity of the group; the dependence of the group on the good; common understanding of the group; the size of the total collective benefit; the marginal contribution by one person to the collective good; the size of the temptation to free ride; the loss to cooperators when others do not cooperate; having a choice of participating or not; the presence of leadership; past experience and level of social capital; the autonomy to make binding rules; and a wide diversity of rules that are used to change the structure of the situation
Evolution
Core group can cooperate and establish norms, especially if a leader is present. Clear group boundaries help establish trust.
Design-principles of long-surviving, self-organized resource regimes
1. Boundaries (Internet makes easier)
2. Rules: inputs, how much, when, how, local importance
3. Most of those effected able to participate in rule-making
4. Select own monitors, accountable to users
5. Graduated sanctions (quasi-voluntary cooperation)
6. Rapid, low-cost conflict resolution
7. Right to organize
8. (For larger resources) multiple layers of governance
Threats to sustained collective action
In/out-migration.
Government imposition of single set of rules.
Changes in technology.
Transmission failure between generations.
Turning to external sources for help too frequently.
International aid
Corruption
Conflicts between regimes.

On wikipedia: policies, guidelines, essays, failed proposals. Ignore all rules.
Peak in rule revisions 2004-2007. Then shift towards rule talk. Rules grow at constant rate. Older rules faster rate. Newer users are less engaged with rule creation and discussion. Editing rule pages results in more namespaces (more communication), smaller more numerous edits. No reduction in contribution to article content.
(Policies represent perspectives and representativeness, talk represents heuristics and argumentation)}

This work presents several results about consensus when opinions can be represented as points on a metric space or median graph. Rather than focusing entirely on voting and preference aggregation, the authors consider the deliberative process using a formalized model. Results use the concept of a generalized median over graphs or Rn. Results apply both to opinion formation and strategic bargaining.
One result shows that when a Condorcet winner exists, it will coincide with the generalized median. The proof uses the concept of gateway nodes, which connect an external point to all points of a convex hull via shortest paths. The authors note a related result that even when no Condorcet winner exists, participants can still converge to a central point.
Is the nested clique a median graph? What do the basins of attraction of two neighboring nodes look like on a nested clique?
The paper also shows that pairwise interactions cannot find an approximation of the generalized median, while triadic interactions can find one quickly. This result is subject to a consistency constraint formalized in terms of the convex hull in opinion space.
The paper refers to median graphs, but does not explain how the nodes and edges of such graphs relate to opinions. Since the l1 norm is used, a lattice of points in Rn would form a median graph, but the results should hold in an arbitrary median graph with a metric distance. When using median graphs, only opinions initially held by some participant can be found, limiting the ability for creativity and compromise. How can these be incorporated? Also, do opinions really exist on a metric space?}

Describes two types of signals: generated and interpreted. Generated are samples from a distribution. Interpreted are based on independent subsets of attributes. Generated are uncorrelated, while interpreted are negatively correlated (conditioned on at least one outcome). Interpreted signals depend on perspective and heuristics. Generated signals are unlimited in number, while interpreted are limited.
Diversity. For interpreted signals, negatively correlated agents can improve group performance.
Example: restaurant meals vs. restaurant location/prices.
Task structure. With interpreted signals, the number of signals depends on the number of attributes.}

Analyzes network structure of hierarchical comment threads on slashdot (Aug 26, 2005 - Aug 25, 2006), finding that political discussions are both "wide" and "deep," signifying deliberation. 2m comments, 10k users, 10k discussions. Equates width/depth with representation/argumentation. Simple model uses width/depth, refined model uses PCA. Similar results for both.
Digital Democracy. Internet can overcome censorship for wider participation. Can amplify preferences and polarize, or can build consensus.
Deliberative theory. Conditions include equality of all participants, representativeness of arguments. "Deliberation is based on social interactions between heterogenous individuals that are able to revise their preferences in the light of the arguments defended by others." Preferences are transformed rather than aggregated. (Habermas 1984, 1987). "Strong democracy" replaces representation with participation (Pateman. Cohen. Fishkin. Barber). Procedural / consequentialist (Landa and Meirowitz 2009). Polarization (Schkade et al 2007).
Teams. Large groups can be dominated by small numbers of charismatic speakers.}

Using agent-based modeling, shows that for problems difficult for any one agent to solve individually, random groups out-perform groups of the best agents. Group of best agents has significantly less structural diversity. Functional diversity (vs identity diversity).
Perspectives and heuristics. Maximize an objective function. Perspective: mapping M from solutions into agent's internal representation. Heuristic: mapping A from solutions in internal rep to subset. (These might influence deliberation and be causes for differing rankings). Easy to collaborate with same perspective but different heuristics.
Thm. Conditions 1. intelligent agents, 2. difficult problem, 3. Agents are diverse 4. Best agent is unique. Random collection outperforms selection of best.

Presents commons-based peer production as an alternative to markets, firms, and states. Uses examples including NASA click workers, Wikipedia, Kuro5hin, Google search, Slashdot.
Challenges are motivation and organization (coordination). Advantages are that individuals make decisions about the resources they have access to, with peer review and quality control. Also allows larger groups with access to more resources.
New type of organization arising because of low cost communication and storage. Creativity is now the scarce resource (also attention).
Motivation. "there exist ranges of human experience in which the presence of monetary rewards is inversely related to the presence of other, social-psychological rewards." Examples: sex, marriage, dinner party. (All involve building social bonds, money is meant to break social bonds). Decomposability. If tasks can be broken up into small pieces, required motivation is small. Allows asynchronous collaboration between individuals (or small groups). Heterogeneous granularity allows individuals to work at appropriate level. Low-cost integration and quality control are necessary.
Peer production
1. Utterance 2. accreditation 3. distribution.
Content. Boundaries (like Ostrom) are defined by Wikipedia policies. Kuro5hin has guidelines for quality control.
Accreditation. Can accreditation be peer-produced? Yes. Slashdot Karma.
II Peer production in networked environment.
Theoretical space: Ronald Coase "The Nature of the Firm" and Demsetz "Toward a theory of property rights". Arises when peering more efficient than market based solution and opportunity cost of property regime outweighs benefits.
Networked environment. Information is purely nonrival (yes, but attention is not). Low capital cost of production. Creative talent is variable, making allocation an important and difficult task.
Information processing. Claims that for some tasks, peer production is more efficient than markets or firms. Information gains. Agents act when they believe the value of an outcome to be greater than the effort/resources. Also depends on valuation by other agents: uncertainty. (Connect to framework). Interdependence creates uncertainty (depending on trust). Hierarchy is lossy medium.
"the primary source of gains-which may be called information gains-that peer production offers is its capacity to collect and process information about human capital." Intellectual effort highly individuated (like HP2004).
"It is not only, or even primarily, that more people can participate in production. The widely distributed model of information production will better identify who is the est person to produce a specific component of a project, all abilities and availability to work on the speciic module within a specific time frame considered."
Allocation gains. Non-proprietary allows recombination of resources.
III Motivation
Monetary. Intrinsic hedonic. Social-psychological.
"Peer production is limited not by the total cost or complexity of a project, but by its modularity, granularity, and the cost of integration." (Depends on task type and network structure.)
Integration function must be low-cost and/or modular.
Quality control: hierarchical, peer review, norms-based, aggregation/averaging.
On slashdot 90\% of registered users can review moderators, who can review contributions. (Heterarchy)
